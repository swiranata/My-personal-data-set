The figure shows the connection between teams power play goals for versus against. It can be inferred that the top team for special teams has a higher power play goals for and much lower power play goals against. You can also see there are a couple points where the power play goals agasint was very high compared to power play goals for which can infer that those are most likely the weakest teams.
