# NHL Special Teams Statistics 2018-2019 Season

# Motivation
As a former hockey player, I always wondered how much of an impact special teams in the big league and so I wanted to try and correlate the top teams in the NHL to their power play and penalty kill rankings.

The figure shows the connection between teams power play goals for versus against. It can be inferred that the top team for special teams has a higher power play goals for and much lower power play goals against. You can also see there are a couple points where the power play goals agasint was very high compared to power play goals for which can infer that those are most likely the weakest teams.
